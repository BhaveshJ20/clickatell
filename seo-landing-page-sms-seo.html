                        <p>SMS (commonly referred to as a text messaging) stands for Short Message Service which is a protocol used for sending short text messages via mobile networks. It’s one of the oldest and most commonly used forms of communication
                            thanks to its universal nature – even the most basic cellphones can receive this form of text messaging.</p>
                        <p>Clickatell’s SMS gateway enables businesses to send bulk SMS messages to 6 billion mobile phone users across the globe – that’s over 85% of the world population. It comes as no surprise then, that one-way (1-Way) bulk SMS messaging
                            is often a preferred marketing and communication channel for businesses, and not only due to its vast reach.</p>

                                    Short codes are country specific and can't be used if you want to receive messages from international customers so you’ll need to have a short code in the country where your customers are.</p>

                                    cheaper to use than short codes and allow you to receive replies from local and selected international destinations. If you need to receive replies to your text messages but it’s not as important that people easily
                                    remember your number, then a long number is the most cost-effective solution to start a two-way conversation with your customers.</p>
