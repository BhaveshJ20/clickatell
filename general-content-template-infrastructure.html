                    <h2>Availability, uptime and processing speed</h2>
                    <p>Adyen’s systems have been designed for maximum uptime through a redundant and stateless service-oriented architecture (SOA) that simultaneously accepts payments on multiple physical hosting locations.</p>
                    <p>Adyen’s standard real-time reporting dashboard contains SLA reports. Processing speed is typically under one second, including risk checks, depending on the speed of the underlying acquirer and/or issuer involved. It has been designed
                        to handle large volume including comprehensive fraud screening.</p>
                    <h2>Hosting facilities</h2>
                    <p>Adyen currently hosts its main systems in separate data centers in Europe, in the United States and Australia. We administer and manage all our own servers. All payments processed are stored in Europe. We do not outsource any administration
                        to third parties, nor do we use any public cloud services for payment processing.</p>
                    <p>All systems are connected to a dual Internet uplink. With Ethernet bonding on multiple redundant switches and dual power from independent feeds, Adyen achieves maximum redundancy for its customers.</p>
                    <h2>Software and hardware</h2>
                    <p>Adyen is fully built on open source software. This gives us maximum control over our software components while remaining independent of any third party. All development, system administration, networking, database administration and
                        security activities are performed in-house by Adyen experts.</p>
                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p>The majority of our developers are employed by Adyen at our Amsterdam headquarters, and work closely together with Adyen departments around the world. Crucially, we publish new releases of our core system every week – without downtime
                        and without the active involvement of our customers.</p>
