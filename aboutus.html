                                <p>In a tiny apartment in Cape Town, our (now) CEO Pieter de Villiers, his twin brother Casper, and two friends Danie du Toit and Patrick Lawson embarked on creating an application programming interface (API) between cellphones
                                    and computers. They did it! They create a world’s first: four lines of code that created a way to send SMS from the internet to cell phones. </p>
                                <p>The team then introduced Clickatell’s chat capabilities in developing countries, including South Africa. Here, limited transportation infrastructure makes it difficult to shop and bank at stores and financial institutions,
                                    and a cell phone is the primary communication device. Brands were in search of a mobile messaging, engagement and commerce solution to conduct business with these mobile-based customers. We delivered.</p>
                                <p>Today, Clickatell’s solutions are utilized by companies around the world and across industries for customer care, commerce, customer acquisition, customer retention, and customer expansion.</p>
