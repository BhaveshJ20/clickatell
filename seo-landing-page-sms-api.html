                        <p>An SMS API allows you to integrate SMS services with your website, third-party application or service, mobile app, CRM etc. An API for sending SMS messages is the easiest way to send automated bulk SMS messages directly from your
                            own platform.</p>
                        <p>In basic terms, an API like the SMS gateway APIs offered by Clickatell, are a means by which the functions of one computer program or script are made available for use by another. By using an SMS API to connect to Clickatell’s
                            SMS gateway, you have the ability to start sending and receiving messages, via any application, instantly.</p>
                        <p>You can communicate with our SMS API in PHP, C#, Javascript, or just about any other coding language your development team is working in. For example, an e-commerce site may integrate an SMS API for authentication purposes as well
                            as to send delivery status messages and notifications of special promotions; the education sector integrates an SMS API for reminders for exams and parent-teacher meetings as well as new student recruitment; retailers integrate
                            an API for text messaging to increase foot traffic to their brick and mortar stores; and event organizers often use SMS API integration to confirm event details with attendees. These are just a few of the plethora of ways that
                            our customers are currently integrating our SMS APIs.</p>
