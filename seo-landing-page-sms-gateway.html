                        <p>Have you ever received an SMS message on your phone from your bank or another organization and wondered how it got there? Chances are your SMS text message was delivered through the Clickatell SMS Gateway which is one of the largest
                            SMS platforms in the world, delivering text messages securely, reliably, and instantly to more than 6 billion people worldwide.</p>
                        <p>No messaging apps, no texting apps. You can send a text message with just one simple integration with our SMS gateway API, in no time. With a 98% open rate, SMS is a universal mobile solution because it works on all phones worldwide,
                            regardless of the type of phone you’re trying to send to. Even the most basic mobile phone can receive SMS text messages. Let’s say, for example, you want to send timely SMS notifications to many or all of your customers. They
                            would have SIM cards from different mobile networks and could be located anywhere in the world. It would be virtually impossible to keep track of the changes that people make to their mobile phones, switch numbers and networks.</p>
                        <p>How would you reliably reach them every time? What would you do if hundreds of people replied to your message or want to unsubscribe from further messages? How would you make sure that they didn’t receive an SMS in the middle of
                            the night?</p>
                        <p>With Clickatell’s SMS gateway, you reach your customers anywhere on their phone in the simplest and most cost-effective way. Think of the Clickatell SMS gateway as a massive computer that’s connected to over 1000 mobile networks
                            across the world on the one hand, and your business application on the other. This means that you don’t need to connect individually with every mobile network, you only need to connect one – to Clickatell’s SMS gateway.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our SMS gateway will intelligently deliver your messages at the right time, to the correct mobile number, on the correct handset, in the correct country, anywhere in the world. With our SMS APIs it makes the task of integrating
                            text messaging a breeze.</p>

                            <p>Bulk SMS is not only used for marketing purposes though. Many businesses use one-way SMS messaging to improve internal processes and communication between employees, for example, and financial institutions take advantage of
                                the immediacy of SMS for time sensitive messages like one-time PINs.</p>
